<h1 align="center">Unity Pomodoro Documentation</h1>

# Disclaimer!
This is a work in progress and not ready for public consumption.
My intention is to remove the [unity-pomodoro wiki tab](https://github.com/adrian-miasik/unity-pomodoro/wiki) when this repo has developed some more.

## About
`unity-pomodoro-docs` is documentation mostly generated from our [`unity-pomodoro`](https://github.com/adrian-miasik/unity-pomodoro) source code using [DocFX](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx).
However, we also have numerous articles that were written to help support and get developers to better understand the `unity-pomodoro` source code.
