## Author Notes
- This documentation repo is a work in progress and not ready for public consumption. My intention is to remove the wiki tab from the `unity-pomodoro` repo when this repo has matured some more.

## About
`unity-pomodoro-docs` is a documentation [website](https://adrian-miasik.github.io/unity-pomodoro-docs/) mostly generated from our [`unity-pomodoro`](https://github.com/adrian-miasik/unity-pomodoro) source code using [`DocFX`](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx).
However, we also have numerous articles that were written to help support and get developers to better understand the `unity-pomodoro` source code.
