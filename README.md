## About
`unity-pomodoro-docs` is a documentation website mostly generated from our [`unity-pomodoro`](https://github.com/adrian-miasik/unity-pomodoro) source code using [`DocFX`](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx).
However, we also have numerous [documents](documents/home.md) that were written to help support and get developers to better understand the source code and architecture.
