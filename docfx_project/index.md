## About
`unity-pomodoro-docs` is a documentation website mostly generated from our [`unity-pomodoro`](https://github.com/adrian-miasik/unity-pomodoro) source code using [`DocFX`](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx).
However, we also have numerous [documents](documents/home.md) that were written to help support and get developers to better understand the source code and architecture.

**API Version**: 2.0.0

> [!NOTE]
> The API version should align up with your [`unity-pomodoro`'s](https://github.com/adrian-miasik/unity-pomodoro) project version to view the corresponding API.
> Meaning if you are on unity-pomodoro `1.7.0`, you should be reading unity-pomodoro-docs `1.7.0`. The forth digit is reserved for updating small visual bugs and typos to this documentation
> `1.7.0.1`.
> Make sure to at least match up the first three numbers for API accuracy. `[MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH, ...]`
