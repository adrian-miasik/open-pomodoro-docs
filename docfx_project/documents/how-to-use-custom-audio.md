# How to Use Custom Audio

Custom audio support has been added in `v2.5.0`.
If you are using an older version of the application, please update your application to access and use this functionality.

1. Locate the `StreamingAssets` folder for your platform:
	- Windows
		- 64 Bit: `unity-pomodoro-2.5.0-windows-desktop-64-bit/Unity Pomodoro_Data/StreamingAssets/`
		- 32 Bit: `unity-pomodoro-2.5.0-windows-desktop-32-bit/Unity Pomodoro_Data/StreamingAssets/`
	- Mac: `unity-pomodoro-2.5.0-mac-desktop-64-bit-apple-silicon.app/Contents/Resources/Data/StreamingAssets/`
	- Linux: `unity-pomodoro-2.5.0-linux-desktop-64-bit/Unity Pomodoro_Data/StreamingAssets/`
2. Drag n' Drop your **.mp3**/**.wav** file(s) into this `StreamingAssets` directory
3. Open Unity Pomodoro
4. Navigate to the Settings Page (Menu -> Settings)
5. Click the **`Set alarm sound`** dropdown
	- Your custom audio will populate and show up as a dropdown option here. 
	- Options suffixed with a ".mp3"/".wav" indicate custom audio files.
6. Select your custom audio file.
7. Done! You have successfully set your timer to utilize your own custom alarm audio!
